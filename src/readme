What kind of files lead to a lot of compression?

After running th experiments, it seemed that the files in the calgary directory had the most compression 
at 43.239% with a .387 completion time.

The files in BooksAndHTML also had a high compression percentage at 40.460% average. This makes books and HTML files more less compressible than the calgary files, but more compressible than the waterloo tif files that 
had a 18.137 completion percentage.

What kind of files had little to no compression?
The tif (image) files had little to no compression. Their percentage was the lowest compared to the other files
and this might have to do with the RGB values present in each pixel of the image that has 256 different intensity. This will result in inefficient compression because of difficulty with ASCII values.

What happens when you try and compress a huffman code file?
I found that it was possible to compress a Huffman code file that has already been cmopressed. Upon my experiment, I continously compressed calgary files and saw a trend. In the second trial, the compression percentage increased, while on the third attempt the percentage decreased. From this, I deduced that the
percentage increased in the second compression by a tiny bit because it was compressing fresh encoded data. The third trial made the file size larger because there was a difference in the encoding which lead to less compression.
